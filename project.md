# Project: NaNo PC Parts

## Dependencies
- Python 3.10+
- Packages: `pyvinted`, `lbc` available via pip
- See `pc_component_mixer.md` for how price comparison works
- use openrouter for ai (see context7 openrouter doc)
- See `openrouter.txt` for API key and model setup
- Use delays between pagination request
- Search extensively how the packages works by going to doc and exploring its functionnalities in the package inside the github repo.
- pyvinted repo https://github.com/herissondev/vinted-api-wrapper
- lbc repo https://github.com/etienne-hd/lbc
- Use MCP (context7 + GitHub browsing) to explore documentation and functions of pyvinted and lbc.
- use context7 mcp to know more about openrouter

## Workflow
1. Fetch the 100 latest GPU listings from **Vinted** (via `pyvinted`) don't fetch more
2. Fetch the 100 latest GPU listings from **Leboncoin** (via `lbc`) don't fetch more
3. Combine results → one JSON with ~200 listings
4. Use **OpenRouter AI** to extract standardized keywords (GPU models)  
   - Input: raw listing titles/descriptions  
   - Output: keywords (ex: `"RTX,3070"`, `"RX,6700XT"`)  
5. Run: pc_component_mixer.py --components graphic_card --keywords {ai_generated_keywords}
    → fetches current market price for each GPU
    - don't modify this script
    - run this script for each lbc and vinted listing found
6. Build output JSON with:  
- source (vinted/leboncoin)  
- title  
- url  
- listing_price  
- current_price  
- ai_keywords  
- rating (1–10, generated by AI
7. Use **OpenRouter** to generate a deal rating:  
- 10 = best possible deal  
- 5 = average market price  
- 1 = overpriced

## Deliverable
- A JSON file `gpu_deals.json` with ~200 entries containing listing info, current price, and AI-generated deal rating.
